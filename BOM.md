## Bill of Materials  

The BOM is found [here](/N2630-REV30-BOM.csv).

Most components to assemble the N2630 are available at any good electronic supply house. The MC68030 and MC68882 will need to be obtained through a retailer that deals in legacy Motorola devices. At the time of writing this, you should expect to pay US$30 - $50 each. DO NOT buy components where you get five chips for $20. These are almost always counterfeit or remarked chips. Save yourself a lot of misery and pay for the real ones.

Most compents in the BOM are general purpose passive and logic parts with many compatable alternatives. It is difficult to keep a list of part numbers that remains valid, even for a short period of time. Because of this, only the part type, value, and footprint is listed. For some parts, to avoid ambiguity, I have listed Digikey part numbers to help you understand what is needed. You can cross reference the Digikey part number should it ever go out of stock.

128-PGA sockets are very difficult to find, and very expensive, if you do find them in stock. A good alternative is to use machine pin strips to make your own socket. It is not pretty, but it works well.

**NOTE:** 

1) Be sure to select 166MHz SDRAM. Slower SDRAM may not work at 50MHz.
2) Sockets are NOT listed in the BOM. I prefer 3M sockets for my projects.
3) Components not listed on the BOM are reserved for future use and do not need to be populated.
