### I already have a Zorro 2 memory card. Can I install less than 8 megabytes and use my existing card?
For maximum performance, it is advisable to install the maximum amount of Zorro 2 RAM on the N2630 card. The memory on the N2630 is 32 bits wide and will maximize performance of the 68030. Zorro 2 RAM on other cards will be only 16 bits wide, thus reducing throughput of the 68030.

In the event you have a card that only DMA's to itself, such as the GVP Impact Series II, you may place a jumper at Jxxx to limit the on board RAM to 4MB. This will provide 4MBs for the RAM on the DMA device to autoconfigure.

### Blah blah blah?
Bleh bleh bleh.
