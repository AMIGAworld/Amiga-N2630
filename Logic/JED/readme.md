These are the current production JED files for programming the Xilinx CPLDs.

The U600 "SE" logic replaces the E clock CIA timing in favor of timings from the 8520A datasheet. This is the preferred logic for most applications. If you have a Zorro 2 device that relies on E clock timings, you should use the non-SE logic version for U600.
