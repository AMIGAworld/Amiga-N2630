There are two PAL program changes here.  The new U505, along with the 
associated pullup resistor, adjusts the A2630 itself for operation that's been
tested up to 33MHz.  The new U600, along with a jumper wire described in the
PAL file, adjusts the board timing for increased efficiency with most 80ns
DRAM.  Along with that, I changed U603 from a 25ns part to a 15ns part, though
the program is unchanged.

At present, the A2630 Fast memory system still has problems at 32-33MHz, but 
is quite stable at 28MHz.  Should I ultimately find the problem at 33MHz, I
will pass on the additional changes.
