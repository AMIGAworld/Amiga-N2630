The purpose of this list is to catalog devices that have been tested with the N2630. This allows users to understand what is known to work and what may not work, as well as alert developers of potential issues. In the event a plug in card or peripheral does not work, it is recommended to add this as a new issue to the repository. Everyone is encouraged to create a pull request to update this list.
